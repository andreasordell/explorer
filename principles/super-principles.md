# Super Principles
First, there are three main "super" principles which constitutes the philosophical foundation for our way of working together.

## Artful Participation
Artful participation is an important part of self-leadership: How do you choose to participate when we work together? For self-governance to work, everyone of us need to look ourselves in the mirror, reflect on and adapt our behaviour more consciously so that we can contribute in the most authentic and full way possible. Sometimes we need to go out of our comfort zones and speak up or hold back. Sometimes we need to challenge norms and assumptions or learn to accept previous agreements. It's about playing a balancing act and knowing when to do either. A kind of art.

## Good enough for now and safe enough to try
At its core, this is an agile principle. It's about prototyping and building on top of small experiments. It's also about not being afraid to make decisions. If it's good enough for now and safe enough to try – i.e. there are no better proposals on the table, or it's not likely to harm us significantly – we just go ahead and do it. There will always be pros and cons and it's easy to get stuck in argument forever. So, let's just do it, evaluate the effects, and build from there.

## It's not "either or", it's "both and more"
The brain loves to break down this complex and mysterious reality into small little manageable boxes. We like to think about things as either black or white, when, in reality, the picture is vivid with all kinds of colours and perspectives. It might feel better or easier to categorise solutions into these boxes, saying that one thing is more real or desirable than another, but in practice this limits our perception. If we want to collaborate more effectively, we need to practice our individual and collective ability to consider more possibilities than one. A "both-and" perspective forces us to look behind the corner of our own limitations. Maybe we'll discover more than we thought possible.

## Seven Principles of Sociocracy 3.0
The three super principles make up the core foundation of self-governance. To make things even easier to understand and practice, there are also seven principles from S3 that guide us in our decision making and collaboration. These are, without any specific internal order:

### Effectiveness
We devote time only to what brings us closer towards achieving our objectives. Everything else is considered waste, like a meeting without new insights or decisions. It's about focusing on and prioritising the most important things in a stormy sea of opportunities and risks.
 
### Accountability
We respond when something is needed, do what we agreed to and take ownership for the course of the organisation. It's about taking responsibility for yourself as well as your team, business unit and the whole organisation. Maybe even society, if you have the courage.
 
### Equivalence
We involve people in making and evolving decisions that affect them. This means that those who are affected by the decision are the right people to make the decision, or at the very least be sincerely listened to. It's also about inviting everyone who has the wisdom or an important perspective to take part in the decision making.
 
### Consent
We do things in the absence of reasons not to. Basically, if it's "good enough for now, safe enough to try", we'll go ahead and do it. There are no reasons not so, so why not just do it then. It's not consensus – not everyone needs to agree to the perfect proposal. We may have different opinions about the details, but only reality will show us which was the right way to go. So, let's try and evaluate instead of talking for hours on end.
 
### Transparency
We make all information accessible to everyone in an organisation, unless there is a reason for confidentiality. Full transparency is the default mode which we strive to live up to in everything we do and how we build systems for documentation. We only keep things hidden if there is a clearly motivated need for it. How else could we expect everyone to contribute fully to the solution?
 
### Empiricism
Assumptions are the building blocks of decision making. We must simplify and assume things, otherwise we wouldn't function. But sometimes assumptions are wrong and misleading.  So, we need to pay attention to them and assess whether they are in touch with reality: We test all assumptions through experiments, continuous revision and falsification. We revise, let go and build new ones.
 
### Continuous Improvement
We change incrementally to accommodate steady empirical learning. This is the extension of empiricism – building a learning culture where we strive to learn, improve and become better over time. For this to happen, we need to document and share our learnings so that we can improve faster instead of repeating old patterns.
